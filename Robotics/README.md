# Robotic Paint Inspection (Webots)

This module integrates the trained CNN-based defect detection model into a robotic inspection pipeline using **Webots**.

## Overview
- Camera-based visual inspection
- CNN inference executed inside a Webots controller
- Designed for real-time defect detection

## Purpose
This module demonstrates how the trained model can be deployed in a simulated robotic environment for automated inspection tasks.

## Note
This module is **not required** for CNN training or evaluation and is provided as an example of system-level integration.
